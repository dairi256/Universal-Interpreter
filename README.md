# Welcome to Universal Interpreter!

This is a project to create a universal interpreter that can interpret most, if not all, coding languages using the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Project Goals

* Create a universal interpreter that can interpret various programming languages
* Utilize AI to enhance the interpreter's capabilities and accuracy
* Release the final version on GitHub, making it available for download and potential extension in popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio

### Project Scope

The scope of this project is ambitious, but I'm committed to doing my best to bring it to life.

### Code Availability

The first version of the code will always be available for use as-is.
